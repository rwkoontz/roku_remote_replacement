# roku_remote_replacement
roku remote app in python3 
I used GTK+ 3 with Glade to throw together a GUI
I'm running this on my Linux Mint laptop and testing it on my TCL Roku TV.

Thanks to https://github.com/jcarbaugh/python-roku and https://github.com/alexdemeo/RokuApp
I looked at both their projects before throwing mine together.
I should also thank the dog for eating the remote today.  Without his motivation I probably never would have bothered.

This project is not well thought out and the code is not commented but maybe I will fix some that in a few days.
The Netflix button doesn't work but after taking another look at the documentation https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/debugging/external-control-api.md#! I now understand why and may fix that sometime
